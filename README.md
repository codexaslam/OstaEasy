## Environment Configuration

This project supports both local development and production deployment with automatic environment detection.

### Production Environment

- **Frontend**: Deployed on Netlify with automatic builds from GitHub
- **Backend**: Deployed on Render with PostgreSQL database
- **Configuration**: Uses `.env.production` for production settings

### Local Development Environment

- **Frontend**: Vite dev server on `http://localhost:5173`
- **Backend**: Django dev server on `http://localhost:8000`
- **Database**: SQLite for local development
- **Configuration**: Uses `.env.local` for development settings

### Environment Auto-Detection

The application automatically detects the environment:

- **Production**: API calls go to `https://ostaeasy.onrender.com`
- **Smart Fallback**: Development environment with production API if needed

## How to Run the Project

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- Node.js latest (18+)
- pnpm (recommended) or npm

### Quick Start with Setup Script

Use the automated setup script to configure both environments:

```bash
# Make the script executable
chmod +x setup-env.sh

# Check environment info
./setup-env.sh info

# Run full setup check
./setup-env.sh check
```

### Manual Setup

#### Backend Setup

1. Navigate to the backend directory:

   ```bash
   cd backend
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment:

   ```bash
   python -m venv ../venv
   source ../venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Run migrations:

   ```bash
   python manage.py makemigrations
   python manage.py migrate
   ```

5. Start the Django server:
   ```bash

   ```bash
   cd frontend
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pnpm install
   # or
   npm install
   ```

3. **Development Mode** (connects to local backend):

### Deployment

#### Production Deployment Setup

**Netlify Frontend Deployment:**

1. Connect GitHub repository to Netlify
2. Set base directory to `frontend`
3. Build command: `pnpm install && pnpm build`
4. Publish directory: `dist`
5. Environment variables automatically set via `netlify.toml`

**Render Backend Deployment:**

1. Connect GitHub repository to Render
2. Uses `render.yaml` for automatic configuration

```

### Database Population

1. **Local Development**: Open `http://localhost:8000` and click "Populate Database"
2. **Production**: Visit `https://ostaeasy.onrender.com` and click "Populate Database"
